# TMA Archive

TMA Archive is a wiki of the Rusty Quill podcast [The Magnus Archives](https://rustyquill.com/show/the-magnus-archives/). It is the product of my attempt to understand the stories presented, and the rich connections between them.

This wiki is not meant to be definitive or complete; other wikis exist for that purpose.

This project is meant to be read with Emacs, and was created with Emacs Org Mode and Org Roam.
